			<h1>Ea sports fc™ 24</h1>
			<p>Ea sports fc™ 24 welcomes you to The World’s Game—the most true-to-football experience ever with HyperMotionV*, PlayStyles optimised by Opta, and a revolutionised Frostbite™ Engine reinventing how 19,000+ authentic players move, play and look in every match. Ea sports fc™ 24 brings you closer to football than ever before, powered by a trinity of technologies driving gameplay realism in every match. HyperMotionV captures football as it’s played and brings that match movement into the game. It’s a year of firsts—improve players in your club with Ultimate Team Evolutions, include women’s footballers in your Ultimate XI, and introduce another dimension to your gameplay with PlayStyles. Create your own club legends by upgrading players via Evolutions objectives. PlayStyles go beyond attributes and overall ratings, equipping footballers with their signature abilities so you can build your squad based on how they actually play on the pitch—and how you like to play. Ultimate means everyone—welcome women’s football to Ultimate Team to unlock a new world of squad building potential. EA SPORTS FC and Marvel have teamed up with UEFA to introduce a new squad of Ultimate Team™ Heroes. Connect and compete with more friends via cross-play** in Clubs and control your footballing destiny with new features in Manager and Player Career. In EA SPORTS FC™ 24, friends can finally share a club with same-gen cross-play. This also unlocks unified leaderboards so that players from different consoles can compete against one another for global placement. Get closer to the touchline with new modern management features in Manager Career including an all-new spectate mode, or pave your own path to glory in Player Career with the help of the Player Agent feature.</p>
